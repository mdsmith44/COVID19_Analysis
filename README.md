# An example bokeh dashboard of US COVID Trends

### Motivation:
Although matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn are great for producing static images, they don't provide as much ability to produce interactive graphics. Bokeh provides the ability to produce rich, interactive graphics that can be shared over the web, and has grown in popularity in recent years.

Here we show how to build an example COVID dashboard in bokeh, as shown at https://mdsmith44.github.io/COVID19_Analysis/.
